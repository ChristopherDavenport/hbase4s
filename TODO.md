### Tasks

1. Better exception handling in query parser.
BUG: search for "fields == value" leads to stack overflow exception (family name missed).

2. Add documentation to README regarding query language and API (put, scan)

3. Add support for get, delete functions

4. Extend filter support with all possible filters plus extend options for existing filters.

5. Give user possibility to tune filter before applying it (externalize filter API).
